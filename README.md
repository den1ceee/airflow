# Airflow

I've created airflow scripts during my study on Karpov.Courses

## DAG-1

**Made in the first generation Airflow paradigm (no decorators)**

My first DAG covers several study objects:

1) to learn the methodology of creating DAGs and uploading them to airflow via Git
2) to answer the questions below with pandas:
- Find the top 10 domain zones by number of domains
- Find the domain with the longest name 
- Where does the domain airflow.com rank?

## DAG-2

**Made in the modern Airflow 2.0+ paradigm**
